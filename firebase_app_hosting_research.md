## Firebase App Hosting Research Notes

### Overview
Firebase App Hosting streamlines the development and deployment of dynamic web apps, offering GitHub integration and integration with other Firebase products like Authentication, Cloud Firestore, and Firebase AI Logic. It has built-in, preconfigured support for Next.js and Angular, as well as broader support for various popular web frameworks.

### Key Capabilities
- **GitHub integration**: Automatic deployment on every push to a specific branch.
- **Backed by Google Cloud**: Deploys apps to Google Cloud products (Cloud Build, Cloud Run, Cloud CDN). Integrates with Cloud Secret Manager for API key safety.
- **AI-powered features**: Supports AI samples using Gemini, with API endpoint protection via Cloud Secret Manager and streaming support.
- **Firebase console integration**: Monitoring builds and rollouts, accessing logs and metrics, custom domain setup, and manual rollout triggers.

### How it Works
1.  **Authorization**: Authorize and install the Firebase GitHub app on your repository via Firebase console or CLI.
2.  **Backend Creation**: Create a Firebase App Hosting backend with a repository and live branch for continuous deployment. A default rollout policy is set to 100% of traffic immediately.
3.  **Commit Push**: A commit to the live branch triggers an event to Firebase App Hosting.
4.  **Build Process**: Firebase App Hosting initiates a new Cloud Build:
    a.  **Buildpacks**: Google Cloud buildpacks determine the framework, create a container, and configure environment variables, secrets, instances, concurrency, memory, CPU, and VPC.
    b.  **Container Storage**: The container is stored in an Artifact Registry repository.
    c.  **Cloud Run Revision**: A new Cloud Run Revision is added to a Cloud Run service using the image and configuration.
5.  **Rollout**: Once the Cloud Run Revision is healthy, Firebase App Hosting points all new requests to the new Revision.
6.  **Request Serving**: Requests are served by Google Cloud Load Balancer with Cloud CDN. Uncached requests go to the Cloud Run service.

### Implementation Path
1.  **Set up Firebase**: Create a Firebase project with the Blaze pricing plan enabled.
2.  **Set up App Hosting**: Create an App Hosting backend via Firebase console or CLI, connecting it to your GitHub repository.
3.  **Manage and Monitor**: Monitor builds and rollouts in the Firebase console. Use Google Cloud console for logs.
4.  **Develop**: App Hosting automatically triggers new rollouts on every commit to the live branch.
